Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BERT in Spark NLP
This code repository is based on Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BERT in Spark NLP, originally posted by Veysel Kocaman on Medium's Towards Data Science.

What is NER?
Named Entity Recognition (NER) involves identifying and categorizing key information (entities) within text. It's also known as entity chunking, extraction, or identification. For more details, you can refer to this source.

NER is a fundamental aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP), allowing us to analyze text and categorize its language.

Usage
This codebase utilizes Google Researchâ€™s Colaboratory for Spark NLP, which functions similarly to Jupyter notebooks for Python. Google Colaboratory is free to use with a Google or Google Drive account.

Instructions
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the provided Jupyter notebook using Google Colaboratory.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the NER with BERT in Spark NLP.
